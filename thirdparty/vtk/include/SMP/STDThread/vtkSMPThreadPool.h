// .NAME vtkSMPThreadPool - A thread pool implementation using std::thread
//
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSMPThreadPool class creates a thread pool of std::thread, the number
// of thread must be specified at the initialization of the class.
// The DoJob() method is used attributes the job to a free thread, if all
// threads are working, the job is kept in a queue. Note that vtkSMPThreadPool
// destructor joins threads and finish the jobs in the queue.
