// Provide a VTK_ALWAYS_EXPORT macro.
//
// Issue:
// Dynamic cast is not just based on the name of the class, but also the
// combined visibility of the class on macos. When building the hash_code of
// an object the symbol visibility controls of the type are taken into
// consideration (including symbol visibility of template parameters).
// Therefore, if a class has a component with private/hidden visibility then
// it cannot be passed across library boundaries.
//
// Solution:
// The solution is fairly simple, but annoying. You need to mark template
// classes intended for use in dynamic_cast with appropropriate visibility
// settings.
//
// TL;DR:
// This markup is used when we want to make sure:
//  - The class can be compiled into multiple libraries and at runtime will
//    resolve to a single type instance
//  - Be a type ( or component of a types signature ) that can be passed between
//    dynamic libraries and requires RTTI support ( dynamic_cast ).
