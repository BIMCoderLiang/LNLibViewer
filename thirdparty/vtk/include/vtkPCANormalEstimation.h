 * @class   vtkPCANormalEstimation
 * @brief   generate point normals using local tangent planes
 *
 *
 * vtkPCANormalEstimation generates point normals using PCA (principal
 * component analysis).  Basically this estimates a local tangent plane
 * around each sample point p by considering a small neighborhood of points
 * around p, and fitting a plane to the neighborhood (via PCA). A good
 * introductory reference is Hoppe's "Surface reconstruction from
 * unorganized points."
 *
 * To use this filter, specify a neighborhood size (SampleSize) or/and a
 * neighborhood radius (Radius). This may have to be set via
 * experimentation. Both options can be set with SetSearchMode.
 * If SearchMode is set to KNN, K points (set by SampleSize) are selected
 * regardless of their location. If Radius is also set to a value different
 * from 0, the code checks if the farthest point found (K-th) is inside this
 * radius. In that case, the selection is performed again to return all
 * points inside this radius, indicating that the initial SampleSize was
 * probably too small compared to the cloud density. Otherwise, if the
 * farthest point is outside the radius, the selection is kept unchanged.
 * If SearchMode is set to Radius, the surrounding points are
 * selected inside the radius. If SampleSize is also set to a value greater
 * than 0, the code checks if at least SampleSize (K) points have been
 * selected. Otherwise, the selection is performed again to include
 * SampleSize (K) points, indicating that the initial Radius was
 * probably too small to estimate the normals relative to the low density
 * of the cloud.
 * Default behavior is KNN with no radius checked (radius is null).
 * Both approaches give the same results. The first approach is faster for
 * uniform point clouds, in other cases, the second approach is faster.
 * In addition, the user may optionally specify a point locator (instead of
 * the default locator), which is used to accelerate searches around the
 * sample point. Finally, the user should specify how to generate
 * consistently-oriented normals. As computed by PCA, normals may point in
 * arbitrary +/- orientation, which may not be consistent with neighboring
 * normals. There are three methods to address normal consistency: 1)
 * leave the normals as computed, 2) adjust the +/- sign of the normals so
 * that the normals all point towards a specified point, and 3) perform a
 * traversal of the point cloud and flip neighboring normals so that they
 * are mutually consistent.
 *
 * The output of this filter is the same as the input except that a normal
 * per point is produced. (Note that these are unit normals.) While any
 * vtkPointSet type can be provided as input, the output is represented by an
 * explicit representation of points via a vtkPolyData. This output polydata
 * will populate its instance of vtkPoints, but no cells will be defined
 * (i.e., no vtkVertex or vtkPolyVertex are contained in the output).
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
