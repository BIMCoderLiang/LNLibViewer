 * @class   vtkNonLinearCell
 * @brief   abstract superclass for non-linear cells
 *
 * vtkNonLinearCell is an abstract superclass for non-linear cell types.
 * Cells that are a direct subclass of vtkCell or vtkCell3D are linear;
 * cells that are a subclass of vtkNonLinearCell have non-linear interpolation
 * functions. Non-linear cells require special treatment when tessellating
 * or converting to graphics primitives. Note that the linearity of the cell
 * is a function of whether the cell needs tessellation, which does not
 * strictly correlate with interpolation order (e.g., vtkHexahedron has
 * non-linear interpolation functions (a product of three linear functions
 * in r-s-t) even thought vtkHexahedron is considered linear.)

   *
   * This method differs from the vtkCell::Clip function in such a way
   * that it tells more information about how the clipped cell was
   * handled. For 2D cells vtkCell::Clip is expected to return either
   * triangles, quads or polygon, and for 3D cells either tetras or
   * wedges. However, it is interesting (especially for non linear cells)
   * to be able to return the same cell type when the cell is totally
   * inside or outside the clipping function. This Clip function
   * resolves exactly this issue by returning a bool : if StableClip
   * returns true then the newly inserted cell is the same type as the
   * current cell, otherwise it will be one of the "expected" types
   * as returned by vtkCell::Clip.
   *
   * Note: This function could also benefit being moved to vtkCell but
   * requires much more work to be supported by all cell types.
